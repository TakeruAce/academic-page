    summary: |
      This paper demonstrates how a handheld force feedback device can present various material properties (e.g., inertia, viscosity, stiffness) of virtual objects through combined visual and haptic cues. By conducting interviews and psychological experiments, it clarifies how humans perceive these material qualities, providing foundational insights for the field of entertainment computing.
